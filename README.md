## Performance Observation
After reviewing and restarting the browsers, no performance issues are observed. All extensions work as expected without slowing down the system.

## Research Summary
Malicious extensions can:
- Steal personal data (passwords, form info)
- Track browsing behavior
- Inject ads or redirect users to fake sites
- Slow down the browser or crash pages
- Act as backdoors for remote control

No such behavior is found in the current installed extensions.

## Outcome
All extensions are reviewed, found to be safe, and are kept based on active or potential use. The browser remains secure and performs well. No extensions are removed.
